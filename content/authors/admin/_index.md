I am a Data Scientist at Velan and also a master's student in Genomics at McGill University.

In my work as a Data Scientist, I apply ML and data science to decipher various business, engineering and supply chain problems. I also deploy end-to-end ML pipelines in production.

My research is in machine learning and its application in genomics and personalized medicine. Therefore, I get to collaborate closely with faculty members from both machine learning and genomics.

My academic background has mainly been in Mathematics, but I also have extensive coursework in computer science and economics.
